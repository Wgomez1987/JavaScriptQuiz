# JavaScriptQuiz
## I present to you, an ALMOST functioning quiz.  The quiz begins with the "start button."  The timer goes off, then we are presented with a question.  After the user selects the answer to the question, the user must press "next question" to see the next question.  If the user answers a question incorrectly, the timer reduces by 5 seconds.  When the user answers all the questions, the score is parsed into the "high scores" button.  Thank you.
